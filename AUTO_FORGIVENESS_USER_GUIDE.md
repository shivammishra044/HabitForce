## Setting Details

### Option Name
**Auto-Forgiveness Tokens** 🛡️

### Description
"Automatically use forgiveness tokens at end of day to protect your streaks"

### Default State
**Enabled** (ON by default)

### What It Does
When enabled, the system will automatically use your forgiveness tokens at 11:50 PM each day to protect habits you missed. This helps maintain your streaks without manual intervention.

## How It Works

### When Enabled (Default)
- ✅ System checks your habits at 11:50 PM daily
- ✅ Identifies habits with active streaks that weren't completed
- ✅ Automatically uses forgiveness tokens (if available)
- ✅ Protects longest streaks first
- ✅ Sends notification about protected habits
- ✅ You wake up with your streaks intact!

### When Disabled
- ❌ No automatic protection
- ❌ You must manually use forgiveness tokens
- ❌ Missed habits will break streaks
- ✅ You have full manual control

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Enabled (Recommended)
**Situation**: You have a 30-day meditation streak but forgot to complete it today. You have 2 forgiveness tokens.

**What Happens**:
- 11:50 PM: System automatically uses 1 token
- Notification: "🛡️ Streaks Protected! We used 1 forgiveness token to protect your Meditation (30-day streak)"
- Next morning: Your 30-day streak is now 31 days!
- Remaining tokens: 1

### Scenario 2: Disabled
**Situation**: Same as above, but auto-forgiveness is disabled.

**What Happens**:
- 11:50 PM: Nothing happens automatically
- Next morning: Your 30-day streak is broken (resets to 0)
- You still have 2 tokens, but didn't use them
- You must remember to manually use tokens before midnight

## Recommendations

### When to Keep It Enabled
- ✅ You want automatic streak protection
- ✅ You sometimes forget to complete habits
- ✅ You value long streaks
- ✅ You prefer convenience over manual control

### When to Disable It
- ❌ You want full manual control
- ❌ You prefer to decide which streaks to protect
- ❌ You want to save tokens for specific situations
- ❌ You're very consistent and rarely miss habits

## Managing Your Tokens

### Viewing Token Count
- **Goals Page**: Quick stats section shows token count
- **Dashboard**: Token display in progress area
- **Notifications**: Alerts when tokens are used

### Token Rules
- **Maximum**: 3 tokens at any time
- **Usage**: 1 token = 1 habit protected for 1 day
- **Priority**: Longest streaks protected first
- **XP**: Auto-forgiveness awards 5 XP (less than manual)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I change this setting anytime?
**A**: Yes! Toggle it on/off whenever you want. Changes take effect immediately.

### Q: What if I run out of tokens?
**A**: Auto-forgiveness won't work if you have 0 tokens. You'll need to complete habits to earn more tokens (future feature).

### Q: Which habits get protected first?
**A**: Habits with the longest streaks are protected first. For example, a 45-day streak is protected before a 10-day streak.

### Q: Will I be notified when tokens are used?
**A**: Yes! You'll receive a notification showing which habits were protected and how many tokens were used.

### Q: Can I manually use tokens even with auto-forgiveness enabled?
**A**: Yes! You can manually use tokens anytime through the habit details or Goals page.

### Q: Does auto-forgiveness respect quiet hours?
**A**: The job runs at 11:50 PM regardless of quiet hours, but notifications respect your quiet hours settings.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Tokens Not Being Used Automatically
**Check**:
1. Is auto-forgiveness enabled in Settings → Notifications?
2. Do you have available tokens (> 0)?
3. Do you have habits with active streaks?
4. Did you miss any habits today?

**Solution**: Verify all conditions above. If everything looks correct, contact support.

### Issue: Wrong Habits Being Protected
**Explanation**: This is by design. The system protects habits with the longest streaks first to maximize value.

**Solution**: If you want to control which habits are protected, disable auto-forgiveness and use tokens manually.

### Issue: Didn't Receive Notification
**Check**:
1. Are in-app notifications enabled?
2. Are you within quiet hours?
3. Check your notification preferences

**Solution**: Adjust notification settings or check the Notifications page for missed alerts.

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Keep It Enabled**: Most users benefit from automatic protection
2. **Check Notifications**: Review which habits were protected each day
3. **Monitor Token Count**: Keep an eye on your remaining tokens
4. **Prioritize Habits**: Focus on building habits you want to protect
5. **Earn More Tokens**: Complete habits consistently (future: earn tokens back)
